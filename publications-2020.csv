ME effects is achieved through elastic deformation between the ferromagnetic and ferroelectric phases. It also depends on the constituent phase properties, the volume concentration and the interfacial conditions. In this paper, we investigate the interfacial effects on the nonlinear ME response of the multiferroic composites consisting both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric through epoy bonding by using a unified micromechanics model. First, the nonlinear coupling behaviors of each individual ferromagnetic or ferroelectric phase are studied by consideration of evolution of the microstructure due to domain switching. Then, the coated or bonded inclusions are treated as a two-phase composite and a homogenization approach is applied to obtain the equivalent properties of the homogenized coated inclusions. Finally, the micromechanics approach is applied again to investigate the overall effective coupling properties of the multiferroic composites consisting coated inclusions and matri. With a focus on the Terfenol-D/PZT/Terfenol-D system, we demonstrate how its coupling coefficients a33, and voltage coefficient aE33depend on the interfacial bonding. Comparisons between the theoretical calculations and the eisting eperimental data agree well.Keywords: Magnetoelectric effects; Interfacial effects; Ferromagnetic/ferroelectric composites; Micromechanics",Mechanics of Materials

In this work we incorporate the contributions of electron-phonon coupling and phonon-phonon interaction into the diffuse mismatch model to establish the temperature dependence of filler-matri interfacial thermal resistance and filler-filler contact resistance, both crucial for thermal conduction in graphene nanocomposites. The electron and phonon transport mechanisms, suitable for metal and nonmetal matrices respectively, are both taken into account. Then through an effective-medium approimation based on Mawell's far-field matching, the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of both metal and nonmetal-based graphene nanocomposites is derived. By further introducing a confinement angle with respect to the main alignment direction wherein the graphene nanofillers are supposed to be dispersed, the influence of the alignment state of graphene nanofillers is also investigated. We highlight this newly developed theory with direct comparisons to several sets of eperimental data, and demonstrate the significant effects of temperature level and alignment state in thermal conductivity of graphene metal and nonmetal nanocomposites.Keywords: Graphene nanocomposite; Thermal conductivity; Interfacial thermal resistance; Temperature dependence; Alignment state",Acta Materialia

In this paper, we take the view that both issues are closely tied to the principle of irreversible thermodynamics, and that, by considering the phase transition from the glassy to the rubbery state in the polymer, and the temperature-affected degradation of the interphase, two independent state variables can be chosen and implemented into a two-scale homogenization scheme. In this approach, we also adopt the temperature-dependent comple modulus in the reduced frequency scale as the homogenization parameter. The developed theory is highlighted with a direct comparison with eperiments. It is demonstrated that, with the addition of graphene fillers, both theory and eperiments show an increase of glass-transition temperature and effective storage and loss moduli, but that, within the glass-transition range, the storage and loss moduli decrease drastically. The present research could provide the directions to tune the glass-transition temperature and storage modulus of graphene-polymer nanocomposite through graphene loading and temperature.Keywords: Glass-transition temperature; Storage modulus; Irreversible thermodynamic processes; Phase transition; Temperature-affected interphase; Graphene-polymer nanocomposites",Journal of Engineering Science

In this paper, a two-level micromechanics model is developed to study the nonlinear magnetoelectric (ME) effects of multiferroic composites consisting both ferromagnetic (or magneto-strictive) and ferroelectric (or piezoelectric) materials. At the first level, the model involves a thermodynamically based evolution of the product domain from the parent one in ferromagnetic phase which provides the nonlinear response of the system under the eternal loading. And at the second level, it treats the ferromagnetic and ferroelectric as a two-phase composite, and Eshelby based micromechanics is applied to obtain the overall effective properties of the composite. Then the two-level model is used to study the nonlinear magnetoelectric effects of Terfenol-D/PZT/Terfenol-D laminated system under the applied magnetic field first, and then under the combined mechanical and magnetic field in different directions. To verify the model, the theoretical calculations have been compared with the eisting eperimental data for both single phase Terfenol-D at the first level and the two-phase Terfenol-D/PZT/Terfenol-D multiferroic composite at the second level. The comparisons between the theory and eperiment are in a good agreement.Keywords: Magnetoelectric effects; Ferromagnetic/ferroelectric composites; Multiferroics; Micromechanics",International Journal of Solids and Structures

American Anthropologist. Vol. 122(3):595-605. In 2014, the Inter?American Court of Human Rights heard two cases concerning the alleged complicity of Honduran state institutions in the violation of Garifuna communal property rights. Garifuna, a people of mied Arawak, Carib, and African descent, are one of nine officially recognized ethnic groups in Honduras. Yet the state has repeatedly denied their status as a pueblo originarioa people native to Hondurasthus calling into question the lawfulness of their claims to national territory. I draw on my eperience serving as an epert witness to analyze the role of cultural evidence in the legitimization of Garifuna rights claims, and how specifically ethnographic treatments of Indigenous cultural practices are circumscribed within dominant juridical interpretive frameworks and modes of recognition. The judgment, issued in October 2015, repeatedly deployed anthropological concepts and insights to bind Indigenous subjectivity to the land, thereby deepening essentialized notions of Garifuna ethnic and racial difference. This article probes the challenges of presenting cultural evidence in a court of law and the limited political potential of witnessing, which, I argue, stem from the ways in which anthropological and legal ways of knowing coarticulate.",American Anthropologist

We show that the orbit stack of a discrete dynamical system on a simply connected manifold encodes the dynamics up to conjugation and inversion. We also prove a generalization of this result for arbitrary discrete groups and non-simply connected manifolds, and relate it to the covering theory of stacks. As applications, we obtain a geometric version of Rieffels theorem on irrational rotations of the circle, we compute the stack-theoretic fundamental group of hyperbolic toral automorphisms, and we revisit the classification of lens spaces.",Rev.
